üìä BASIC TRENDER TESTS IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
=============================================

‚úÖ COMPLETED: Comprehensive test suite for trender system covering all requested scenarios

üß™ IMPLEMENTED TEST SCENARIOS:

1. ‚úÖ CLUSTERING BEHAVIOR (6 fake items ‚Üí 2-3 clusters)
   ‚Ä¢ Test: 6 items (3 similar Taiwan news + 3 different topics)
   ‚Ä¢ Expected: 2-3 clusters (Taiwan items cluster together, others separate)
   ‚Ä¢ Verification: Similar items cluster together, different items form separate clusters
   ‚Ä¢ Mock data: Taiwan military news, AI breakthrough, climate summit, crypto volatility

2. ‚úÖ SCORING LOGIC (Higher scores for more domains + recent items)
   ‚Ä¢ Test: Domain diversity affects diversity_score
   ‚Ä¢ Test: Recency affects freshness_score  
   ‚Ä¢ Test: Combined scoring gives highest scores to recent + diverse clusters
   ‚Ä¢ Verification: Taiwan cluster (3 domains, recent) scores higher than single-domain clusters

3. ‚úÖ TOPIC FILTERING (Taiwan OR Taipei query matching)
   ‚Ä¢ Test: Taiwan topic query matches only Taiwan/Taipei items
   ‚Ä¢ Test: Boolean OR logic works correctly ("Taiwan" OR "Taipei")
   ‚Ä¢ Test: Integration with pipeline topic matching
   ‚Ä¢ Verification: Exactly 3 items match (Taiwan items), 3 don't match (other topics)

4. ‚úÖ SELECTION LIMITS (k_global and per-topic constraints)
   ‚Ä¢ Test: k_global limit respected (never exceed global limit)
   ‚Ä¢ Test: per-topic max_posts_per_run limit respected
   ‚Ä¢ Test: Combined limits work correctly
   ‚Ä¢ Verification: Selector returns at most k_global globally and max_posts per topic

üìã TEST STRUCTURE:

üèóÔ∏è Test Classes:
   ‚Ä¢ TestClusteringBehavior - Clustering with similar/different items
   ‚Ä¢ TestScoringLogic - Domain diversity and recency scoring
   ‚Ä¢ TestTopicFiltering - Taiwan OR Taipei boolean queries
   ‚Ä¢ TestSelectionLimits - k_global and per-topic limits
   ‚Ä¢ TestIntegrationScenarios - Full pipeline integration

üîß Mock Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ MockRawItem - Simulates news items with title, summary, domain, timestamp
   ‚Ä¢ MockClusterMetrics - Simulates scoring results with all metric types
   ‚Ä¢ MockTopic - Simulates topic configuration with queries and settings
   ‚Ä¢ MockSelectedPick - Simulates selection results with scores and metadata
   ‚Ä¢ MockSelection - Simulates final selection with global and topic picks

üìä Test Data Details:

Sample Items (6 fake items):
   Taiwan Items (Similar - should cluster together):
   1. "Taiwan announces new military exercises" (reuters.com, 1h ago)
   2. "Taiwan defense exercises begin amid tensions" (bbc.com, 2h ago)  
   3. "Taipei responds to regional security concerns" (cnn.com, 3h ago)
   
   Different Items (should form separate clusters):
   4. "AI breakthrough in medical diagnosis announced" (techcrunch.com, 4h ago)
   5. "Climate summit reaches historic agreement" (guardian.com, 8h ago)
   6. "Cryptocurrency market sees major volatility" (coindesk.com, 12h ago)

Expected Clustering Results:
   ‚Ä¢ Cluster 101: Taiwan items [1,2,3] - 3 domains, recent
   ‚Ä¢ Cluster 102: AI item [4] - 1 domain, recent
   ‚Ä¢ Cluster 103: Climate item [5] - 1 domain, older
   ‚Ä¢ Cluster 104: Crypto item [6] - 1 domain, oldest
   ‚Ä¢ Total: 3-4 clusters (depending on similarity thresholds)

Scoring Verification:
   ‚Ä¢ Taiwan cluster: High diversity (3 domains), high freshness (recent), high composite
   ‚Ä¢ Single-domain clusters: Low diversity, varying freshness based on age
   ‚Ä¢ Older clusters: Lower freshness scores

Topic Matching:
   ‚Ä¢ Taiwan topic queries: "Taiwan" OR "Taipei"
   ‚Ä¢ Should match items 1, 2, 3 (contain Taiwan/Taipei keywords)
   ‚Ä¢ Should NOT match items 4, 5, 6 (AI, climate, crypto topics)

Selection Limits:
   ‚Ä¢ k_global=3: Returns at most 3 global picks
   ‚Ä¢ max_posts_per_topic=2: Returns at most 2 picks per topic
   ‚Ä¢ Combined: Respects both limits simultaneously
